Leetcode 253

Problem : 
You are given an array of meeting intervals where each interval is [start, end].
Determine whether a person can attend all meetings â€” i.e., no intervals should overlap.

Example:
Input: [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
Output: false

âœ… Intuition

If two meetings overlap, a person cannot attend both.

ðŸ§  Key idea:
Sort the intervals by start time â†’ if any meeting starts before the previous one ends, it is impossible.

âœ… Approach

Sort intervals by start time

Iterate through them

If current.start < previous.end â†’ Overlap â†’ return false

If loop completes â†’ return true

Example

Input:

[[7,10],[2,4]]


Sorted:

[[2,4],[7,10]]


No overlap â†’ âœ… You can attend all meetings

                                class Solution {
                                    public boolean canAttendMeetings(int[][] intervals) {
                                        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);

                                        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
                                            if (intervals[i][0] < intervals[i - 1][1]) {
                                                return false; // overlap
                                            }
                                        }
                                        return true;
                                    }
                                }

Time: O(n log n) due to sorting

Space: O(1) (in-place sorting)
