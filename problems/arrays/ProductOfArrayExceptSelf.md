Problem Statement

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that

answer [i] = prodct of all elements of nums except nums[i]

Constrains : 

Solve without using division
Time Complexity O(n), space complexity O(1) (excluding output array)

Example 1: 

    input : nums =[1, 2, 3, 4]
    output : [24, 12, 8, 6]
    Explanation :
    - answer[0] = 2*3*4 =24
    - answer[1] = 1*3*4 =12
    - answer[2] = 1*2*4 =8
    - answer[3] = 1*2*3 =6

Example 2 :

    input : nums = [-1, 1, 0, -3, 3]
    output : [0, 0, 9, 0, 0]

üîπ Brute Force Approach

- multiply all other elements for each index
- Time: O(n^2), Space :O(1)

            for (int i=0; i <nums.length; i++){
                int prod = 1;
                for (int j=0; j<nums.length; j++){
                    if(i != j) prod *= nums [j];
                }
                answer [i] = prod;
            }

üîπ Optimized Approach (Prefix & Suffix Products)

Idea:
- Compute prefix products (product of elements to the left of i)
- Compute suffix products (product of elements to the right of i)
- Multiply prefix[i] * suffix[i] for final answer

            public int [] productExceptSelf (int [] nums){
                int n = nums.length
                int [] answer = new int[n]; 

                //Step 1; prefix products
                answer [0] =1 ;

                for(int i=1; i<n; i++){
                    answer [i] = answer [i-1] * nums[i - 1];
                } 

                //Step 2 : suffix products
                int suffix = 1;
                for(int i= n-1; i>=0; i--){
                    answer [i] *= suffix;
                    suffix *= nums[i];
                }
                return answer;
            }

Time complexity : O(n) -single pass for prefix + suffix
Space complexity : O(1) extra(excluding output array)


Step by Step example 

    Input 

    nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]

        | Index | nums[i] | Prefix product | Suffix product | answer[i] |
        | ----- | ------- | -------------- | -------------- | --------- |
        | 0     | 1       | 1              | 24             | 24        |
        | 1     | 2       | 1              | 12             | 12        |
        | 2     | 3       | 2              | 4              | 8         |
        | 3     | 4       | 6              | 1              | 6         |


üîπ Edge Cases

Array contains zeros ‚Üí suffix/prefix handles it automatically

Array length = 1 ‚Üí answer = [1]

Negative numbers ‚Üí works as usual

1Ô∏è‚É£ Typical Interview Phrasing

Direct / Classic:

‚ÄúGiven an array nums, return a new array such that each element at index i is the product of all elements in the array except nums[i]. Can you do it without using division?‚Äù

Variant / Real-world Scenario:

‚ÄúYou are given sales numbers for a week. For each day, compute the total sales excluding that day. Optimize your solution for large datasets.‚Äù

Hints / Leading Questions Interviewers Might Give:

‚ÄúCan you do it in O(n) time?‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you reduce extra space usage?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happens if the array contains zeros?‚Äù

2Ô∏è‚É£ What Interviewers Are Testing
Concept	Why It‚Äôs Tested
Pattern recognition	Do you recognize that prefix & suffix arrays solve the problem efficiently?
Optimization	Can you go from O(n¬≤) brute force to O(n)?
Edge-case handling	Can you handle zeros, negatives, single-element arrays?
In-place / space optimization	Can you reduce extra space to O(1) by reusing the output array?
Communication	Can you explain your approach clearly and walk through an example?

3Ô∏è‚É£ How to Approach in an Interview

Step 1: Clarify the question

Are division operations allowed?

Can the array have zeros or negative numbers?

Expected time & space complexity?

Step 2: Discuss the brute force approach

Nested loops ‚Üí O(n¬≤) ‚Üí show that it‚Äôs too slow

Step 3: Introduce prefix & suffix approach

Draw an example array on the board

Explain how prefix * suffix gives the answer

Step 4: Optimize space (optional)

Reuse output array for prefix products

Use a single variable to track suffix product

Step 5: Walk through edge cases

Zeros, negative numbers, array length 1

Step 6: Conclude with time & space complexity
